          	The orderliness of the Fifties would yield to a more chaotic<br> and revolutionary tenor by the mid-Sixties. A new illustration<br> style, one which borrowed freely from Surrealism, Pop Art,<br> and Expressionism, was more relaxed and intuitive and the<br> first wave of a post-Modernist sensibility. Specifically, during the <br>late 60s and early/mid 70s, posters reflected the revolutionary<br> ideas of the younger generations. The excesses of the drug culture<br> and political alienation led to a brief but spectacular Psychedelic<br> Poster craze in the U.S., which recalled the floral excesses of Art<br> Nouveau, the pulsating after images of Op-Art, and the bizarre juxtapositions<br> of Surrealism. And the French May Day protests generated a school<br> of propaganda poster that harked back to the Soviet poster and<br> cartoon art of the 20s and 30s.

            In addition, there was a sudden surge in Psychedelic rock posters, originated<br> by Wes Wilson. They appeared in the late 1960s, together with other popular<br> music graphics like Milton Glaser's poster for Bob Dylan's 1967 'Greatest Hits'<br> album. Widespread in San Francisco and New York, the music poster<br> movement expanded into marketing and point-of-sale with free album-posters,<br> as well as promotional concert posters. The craze for this sort of graphic art<br> mirrored the demand for vintage posters in Paris during the late 19th century.

           Additionally, during the rebellious years, Glaser's Push Pin Studio was matched<br> in creativity by a dynamic school of poster art in Poland from the '50s through<br> the '80s. The Polish School became known for a sardonic and gut-wrenching<br> variety of Surrealism in promoting the State-controlled theatre and cultural<br> organizations. Because of this, Polish poster during the 70s and 80s becomes<br> an important influence in terms of poster design throughout the Europe – due to<br> their wish to become independent from the oppression, and rebel against rules.
