          	The International Style spread beyond Switzerland rapidly and became<br> the leading graphic design style worldwide in the Seventies. By the<br> early Eighties, the style began to give way to the Post Modernists,<br> who sought to break the formal and dogmatic rules of the Swiss Style.<br> Memphis design movement marked the beginning of the ‘80s Post—Modern<br> design era. It was started by a group of Italian designers, photographers,<br> and architects inspired by the radical design movement from the 60s. The<br> group’s focus was to break with Modernism and its very restrictive rules,<br> making many designers feel “trapped“. That is from where the goal to<br> break-off the ever-generic Swiss style has come.

            Moreover, a young teacher in Basel named Wolfgang Weingart led the<br> palace revolt which ushered in, today's predominant graphic style loosely<br> known as Post Modern design. Weingart experimented with the offset<br> printing process to produce posters that appeared complex and chaotic,<br> playful and spontaneous - all in stark contrast to his elders' teachings.<br> Weingart's liberation of typography was an important foundation for<br> several new styles, from Memphis and Retro, to the advances now being<br> made in computer graphics.

           Breaking away from the rules and restrictions particular design styles<br> implied marked the beginning of a new era in graphic design. Artists<br> were finally able to explore the depths of their creativity without the<br> need to follow any norms or guides. During the 1980s, a number of<br> new design styles appeared, making this one of the most prolific and<br> influential decades for graphic design. It also, additionally, did not<br> have much of the change, but the prime goal to break off the spell<br> of symmetry and hierarchy was there, and it was ushering as ever before.
