          	World War I meant a new role for the poster: propaganda. The war ushered<br> in the biggest advertising campaign to date, critical to the wartime<br> communication needs of every combatant: from raising money, recruiting<br> soldiers, and boosting volunteer efforts, to spurring production and<br> provoking outrage at enemy atrocities. Utilizing contemporary Madison<br> Avenue techniques, America alone produced about 2,500 striking poster<br> designs and approximately 20 million posters - nearly 1 for every 4 citizens<br> - in little more than 2 years. The lessons of brilliant American advertising in<br> WWI posters were not lost on the Bolsheviks, who turned to poster art<br> to help win their civil war against the Whites. Lenin and his followers proved<br> to be the pioneering masters of modern propaganda, and the poster became<br> a weapon of choice throughout the century in both hot and cold war’s<br> everywhere. After World War I, the focus shifted to more industrial-like<br> advertisements. Society turns its attention to the dynamism of the Machine<br> and all things technological. The industrial focus becomes relevant, and,<br> in that case, so does art take a certain route. The modern art movements of<br> Cubism, Futurism, Expressionism, and Dadaism became chief influences.<br> At the same time, the first graphic design courses were launched in<br> France, Germany and Switzerland, a key moment in the transition <br>from illustration to graphic design in advertising.

            This shift was quickly felt in the Soviet Union, where Constructivist art<br> arose to help create the new revolutionary, technological society. It was<br> mainly an art and architectural movement. It rejected the idea of art for<br> art’s sake and traditional bourgeois class of society. This first flowering<br> movement of the new poster style was inspired by Kashmir Malevich ‘s<br> avant-garde Suprematism movement. The Constructivists developed<br> an "agitational" style of poster composition, marked by strong diagonals,<br> photomontage, and jarring colour. The Constructivists' aggressive stance,<br> as seen in the work of El Lissitsky, Alexandro Rodchenko, Klutsis and the<br> Stenberg Brothers, would have a major impact on Western poster design,<br> primarily through the Bauhaus and de Stijl (the photomontage effect can be<br> seen in the work of Lucian Bernhard). It is important to mention a figure, which<br> is Alexandro Rodchenko. He became an artist and designer of many<br> mediums including painting, photography, sculpture, advertising, and packaging.<br> Heavily influenced by the upheaval surrounding the Russian revolution of<br> 1917, he was one of the most prolific constructivist artists of the period.<br> Rodchenko‘s early focus was on painting before starting his career as a<br> graphic designer, later he would experiment with photography and<br> photo-montage. His work primaraly influenced many designers of the early 20th<br> century that it is impossible to catalog the vast reaches of the idealogy that<br> he helped define during his career.

           By the mid-Twenties, these often disparate modernist approaches would coalesce<br> into a major new international decorative movement called Art Deco. In this<br> machine age style, power and speed became the primary themes. Shapes were<br> simplified and streamlined, and curved typefaces were replaced by sleek, angular<br> ones that would reflect the jazz age. Ever eclectic, strains of Art Deco would also<br> manage to incorporate the exotic arts of Persia, Egypt and Africa. The term Art<br> Deco is derived from the "Decorative Arts" Exposition of 1925 in Paris, which<br> proved to be a spectacular showcase for the style. In Paris, the caricature style of<br> Cappiello gave way to the geometric, intellectual images of A.M. Cassandre, who<br> popularized air brush techniques that lent a machine-like surface to his images.<br> His towering posters of the Normandie, Statendam and Atlantique ocean liners<br> became icons of the Industrial Age. Art Deco, like Art Nouveau before it, spread<br> quickly throughout Europe and to the U.S. (as well as other countries around the<br> globe). Additionally, in the years following World War I, Switzerland developed<br> a clear edge in graphic design, based on their mastery of technical and creative<br> principles from Constructivism, the Dutch De Stijl movement led by Theo van<br> Doesburg (1883-1931), and the Bauhaus Design School. An important figure<br> inside the Swiss poster scene was Ernst Keller, who taught at the Zurich Design<br> School where he nurtured the young group of designers who would later invent the<br> world-famous International Typographic Style. Other leading teachers included the<br> artists Jan Tschichold and Theo Ballmer. Other key factors which have<br> contributed to Swiss excellence in this area, include a formidable printing industry<br> and a willingness by the State and Cantonal authorities to invest in the necessary<br> resources. Today, The International Typographic Style is making a strong<br> come-back in different formats of graphic design, poster design and advertising.<br> Post-World War I, the world began to make a transition from organic poster art to<br> modern art.
