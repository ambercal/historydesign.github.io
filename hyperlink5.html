              By 1900, Art Nouveau had lost much of its dynamism through sheer imitation and<br> repetition. Additionally, several events have caused the decline of this artistical<br> movement. The death of Toulouse-Lautrec in 1901 and the abandonment of poster<br> art by Mucha and Cheret (who both turned to painting) left a void that was filled<br> by a young Italian caricaturist named Leonetto Cappiello who arrived in Paris in<br> 1898. Strongly influenced by Cheret and Toulouse-Lautrec, Cappiello rejected<br> the fussy detail of Art Nouveau. Instead he focused on creating one simple<br> image, often humorous or bizarre, which would immediately capture the viewer's<br> attention and imagination on a busy boulevard. He appreciated the overriding<br> need to create instant visual impact, as exemplified by his 1906 poster designs<br> for Maurin Quina absinthe. This ability to create a brand identity established<br> Cappiello as the father of modern advertising, and details of functionality and<br> visuals can be witnessed in the poster design of 21st century in all spectrums.<br> The style of Cappiello would dominate Parisian poster art until A.M. Cassandre's<br> first Art Deco poster in 1923.

            Meanwhile, from 1905, artists working in Scotland's Glasgow School, Austria's<br> Vienna Secession, and Germany's Deutscher Werkbund also were transforming<br> Art Nouveau's organic approach, and focused towards a simplier, more<br> functional style. These schools rejected curvilinear ornamentation in favor of a<br> rectilinear and geometric structure based on functionalism. More and more<br> poster artists switched from the elegant Art Nouveau to geometric styles, to<br> sharpen the advertising message. A key outgrowth of these modernist efforts<br> was the German Plakatstil, or Poster Style, which was begun in 1905 by Lucian<br> Bernhard in Berlin and in Munich by Ludwig Hohlwein. Minimalized naturalism<br> and emphasis on flat colours and shapes made their work the next step towards<br> creating an abstract, more modern visual language, so that the communication<br> with the audience was more advanced than ever before.

           Ludwig Hohlwein was good at eliminating all non-essential graphics, because<br> he was noted for his use of shadow versus light, as well as his portrayals of<br> people and animals. On the other hand, Lucian Bernhard is another figure<br> in the history of poster design that should not be left out. Bernhard's contribution<br> to the development of modern design, advertising and culture in the early<br> 20th century can be summed up in his poster design for the Priester match<br> company. However, that piece was just the launching pad for his entire career.<br> His advertising work amassed a client list that included Cat's Paw, Westinghouse,<br> ExLax, Bosch, Manoli, Priester, Adler, Amoco and Grand Rapids Furniture<br> Company. In a time when a great deal of theory was developing behind the fields<br> of graphic design and advertising Bernhard worked almost entirely by instinct,<br> saying “You see with your eyes, not your brain.”
