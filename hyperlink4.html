              During the 1890s, referred to as the Belle Epoque in France, poster exhibitions,<br> magazines and dealers proliferated.  In 1891, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's<br> extraordinary first poster, Moulin Rouge, elevated the status of the poster to fine art <br>and touched off a poster craze. Recording the performances he viewed and the <br>establishments he visited on a nightly basis, he functioned as artist and narrator:<br> his paintings, drawings, prints, and posters expose the complexities of the quickly<br> changing age in which he lived. Lautrec found great success in the medium of<br>poster art, as he managed to produce over 350 lithographic posters and illustrations.<br> Despite descending from three lines of aristocracy, Lautrec derived artistic inspiration <br>from the people he lived among in Montmartre’s working-class neighbourhood,<br> including prostitutes, singers, and fellow artists.

            Nevertheless, poster artists were transforming Parisian streets into colourful art galleries<br> for the public, which featured a magnificent matter of Parisian night life, attaining cult <br>status in the process, and causing theatre stars to insist on choosing their own favourite<br> artist to do the poster for their show. Interest in the poster was further enhanced by the<br> emergence of Art Nouveau during the 1890s, a decorative style of art marked by<br> flowing, curvilinear shapes, and drawing inspiration from Byzantine icons, Pre-Raphaelite<br> romanticism and the Celtic Art Revival movement. Largely reliant upon form, line and colour,<br> Art Nouveau proved the ideal poster design, and dominated the Parisian poster scene up<br> until the late 1900s. Not long after, Alphonse Mucha, a Czech artist working in Paris,<br> created the first masterpieces of Art Nouveau in both fine arts and poster design. <br>Bearing multiple influences including the Pre-Raphaelites, the Arts and Crafts Movement,<br> and Byzantine art - this flowering, ornate style became the major international <br>decorative art movement up until World War I. In comparison to today, everyone recognizes<br> Mucha ‘s work – the inspirational level, that most produce, is magnificent.

           Moreover, in each country, the poster was used to celebrate the society's unique cultural <br>institutions. Like mentioned before, in France, the cafe and cabaret was omnipresent.<br> As to such countries like in Italy - the opera and fashion; in Spain the bullfight and<br> festivals; in Germany trade fairs and magazines, in Britain and America literary journals,<br> bicycles, and the circus. Despite cross-pollination, distinctive national styles also<br> became apparent - Dutch posters were marked by restraint and orderliness, and Italian<br> poster was recognized by their drama and grand scale  for their directness and medieval<br> influence. Again, it is important to mention, that despite these differences from country to<br> country, all of them shared similarities because of then ongoing trends in art world, as<br> well as the way the audience is perceived.
