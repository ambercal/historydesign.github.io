          	The role and appearance of the poster has changed continuously over the<br> past century to meet the changing needs of society. Although its role is less<br>  central than it was 100 years ago, the poster will evolve further as<br>  the computer and the worldwide web revolutionize the way we communicate <br> in the 21st century. People begin to think about what changes have taken<br>  place in modern posters since the 21st century, and whether these changes are<br>  good or bad?

            Posters are still sold and displayed worldwide. Today, they are part of a<br> subset of printing design. However, they’re not nearly as popular as other<br> forms of media, particularly with the emergence of the Internet. Posters<br> are designed to promote movies, events, concerts, and they’re also designed<br> for art purposes. Popular poster designs for wall decorating purposes include<br> sports, bands, inspirational, scenic, travel, retro, educational and more. Films<br> account for a large proportion of the whole entertainment industry. But, of <br>course, no doubt, the reoccurance of Swiss Style and Minimalism, is dominating<br> not only the Film industry, but all spheres across the board – main, functional<br> image, giving the audience the right message, minimal usage of colour<br> (usually maximum of two colours), and symetrical or asymetrical hierarchy<br> without a lot of detailing. Many examples of movie posters show a massive<br> change from representational and narritive to iconic and minamalistic.

           The posters today are taped to walls and framed in stylish picture frames.<br> It’s only normal for paper to age and deteriorate with time. To prevent loss of<br> historical value and for preservation, posters are backed with fabric. This<br> method of poster preservation dates all the way back to 19th Century<br> France. More modern poster preservation techniques include using an<br> “acid-free” paper in between the fabric and the poster to avoid paper that<br> becomes “brittle” with time. Not only does fabric backing help to preserve<br> posters, but it also keeps the poster from “waving” when framed, and it <br>keeps the poster flat, which makes it easier when repairs are necessary.<br> Nevertheless, posters have changed into different sizing and the way they<br> are displayed. It so happend because of the rise of the internet meme – an<br> image or piece of text that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users<br> – can be seen as the digital descendent of the poster. While the poster<br> no longer dominates today's media environment, it continues to have a <br>powerful impact, perhaps most critically in the realm of politics and activism.
