          	The poster again played a large communication role in World War II, but<br> this time it shared the spotlight with other media, particularly radio and<br> print. By this time, most posters were printed using the mass production<br> technique, which resulted in the familiar dot pattern seen in newspapers<br> and magazines. The use of photography in posters begun in the Soviet<br> Union in the Twenties, now became as common as illustration. The last<br> grasp of the lithographic poster occurred in Switzerland, where the government<br> heavily promoted the printing industry and poster excellence. Appealing<br> to the Swiss sense of precision, the Sachplakat, or Object Poster Style,<br> developed in the Twenties but blossomed during WWII and the early Fifties<br> in the Basel area. Its artists delighted in making everyday objects into<br> giant icons, utilizing spectacular Swiss printing to create wonderful trompe<br> l'oeil effects. With roots going back to the Plakatstil of Lucian Bernhard and<br> the Surrealist movement, visual elegance was often matched by gentle humour.

            While the Sachplakat was still the No 1 style for Swiss product posters in the<br> 1940s, thanks largely to the efforts of Basel designer-lithographers Stoecklin,<br> Leupin, Birckhauser, and Brun, the 1950s witnessed the replacement of lithographic<br> printing by cheaper offset printing (as mentioned before, this was a mass<br> production technique, which resulted in the same pattern of dots as magazines<br> and newspapers). Other changes were also unavoidable. During the late 1940s<br> and early 1950s, travel posters were increasingly replaced by photographs.<br> Fortunately, Swiss graphic artists were making rapid strides in other areas.<br> During the following decade, they launched a uniform, minimalist style known as<br> The International Typographic Style (this was mentioned beforehand)<br> because of its dependence on typographic elements, such as layout grids, sans<br> serif typefaces, and black and white photography. Developed at the Basel<br> Design School under Armin Hofmann and Emil Ruder, and at the Zurich Design<br> School under Joseph Muller-Brockmann, all of whom had trained under Keller<br> in Zurich school, the style was ideally suited to the post-war multi-lingual global<br> marketplace, and by the 1970s, it had become the foremost graphic style in the<br> world. 21st century has witnessed the reoccurrence of this style, especially in the 10s<br> and 20s – in combination with trends from the 2000s and the 90s of the previous<br> centuries in both advertising and fine art spheres.
