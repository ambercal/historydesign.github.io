          	Despite the looming tensions of the Cold War, the end of World War II<br> ushered in a baby boom and a new consumer society with the arrival of<br> television, jet travel and global brands fuelling the way. Advertising<br> methods shifted to adapt to the times, and so, to the communication with<br> the audience. A veritable "poster boom" occurred in the early 1950s,<br> driving forward two distinct styles, one consumer and one corporate.<br> The first, labelled the '50s Style, was brightly coloured and whimsical,<br> while the second, called the International Typographic Style, was more<br> rational and orderly. Posters done in the '50s Style used vivid colours<br> and playful motifs to appeal to a broad audience. Artists like Herbert<br> Leupin and Donald Brun in Switzerland, and Raymond Savignac in<br> France exemplify the style's light-hearted qualities. The '50s Style<br> was applied to consumer services as well as products. Ever present<br> were marvellous airline campaigns by David Klein, Stan Galli and others<br> which sought to attract travellers to destinations like Disneyland,<br> New York, Las Vegas, and Paris.

            The International Typographic Style (or Swiss Style) was also perfectly<br> suited to the increasingly globally connected world.  Highly structured,<br> systematic designs granted order and clarity to everything from highways<br> and airports to product instruction manuals. That is why it keeps on<br> coming back almost every decade as a trend. Influenced by the Bauhaus<br> and Tshichhold's New Typography, this style developed in Switzerland<br>in the late '50s and '60s. It employed basic typographic elements with<br> strict graphic rules and often replaced illustration with stark, "modern"<br> photography. The concert posters of Josef Muller-Brockmann represent<br> the classical apotheosis of this style - cool, elegant and systematically abstract.<br> On the same level was Erik Nitsche's "Atoms for Peace" series of<br> spectacular posters for the first International Conference on the Peaceful<br> Uses of Atomic Energy.Shortly, Erik Nitsche left an unmistakable remark on the<br> world of design from his golden 60-year long career. Leaving almost no field <br>untouched, he worked as a book designer, art director, photographer, advertiser,<br> packaging designer and even more. His work has a distinctly modernist<br> aesthetic and although he never had the opportunity to attend the Bauhaus.<br>He designed promotional and advertising campaigns for a host of different<br> clients including department stores, feature films, record companies and the<br> New York Transit Authority. Nitsche greatly influenced the young generation<br> of designers in America in the mid-20th century.

           After World War II, advertising-posters everywhere declined in importance as<br> the market was effectively taken over by photography, radio and later television,<br> and so the poster, in one way or another, becomes irrelevant. This was an era<br> of ever-growing technology and richer middle-class. In addition, labour-intensive<br> lithography was also becoming prohibitively expensive, causing advertisers to switch to<br> cheaper but less colourful methods like offset printing and screen-printing (these<br> methods were already talked about in the previous texts). As a result, by the 1960s - <br>despite exceptional campaigns by post artists Bernard Villemot and Raymond Savignac<br> - the poster was no more than a minor genre. Designers who might previously<br> have been attracted to posters were now moving into illustration and other graphic<br> design work.
